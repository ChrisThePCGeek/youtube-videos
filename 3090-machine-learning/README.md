The NVIDIA RTX 3090 is a beast.  We all know it can beat the benchmarks in gaming, but how about machine learning and neural networks?  Today we walk through the RTX 3090 and then compile and run Darknet, an open source neural network, on Windows and then Ubuntu Linux and run object detection on pictures, images, and real-time video.  You will be amazed at how much more you can get out of your video card than just gaming!
